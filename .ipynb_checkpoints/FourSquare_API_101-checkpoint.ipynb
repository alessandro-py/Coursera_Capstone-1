    "\n",
    "## What is API?\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you crate an app, you want to access some data that has been stored some where in a server, so that you can show it on your app (by __`Request`__ and __`Response`__). If you cannot provide the data by yourself, you want to connect to the people who have and ready to give the data that has been managed and stored in a server. So, all you need to do is just to __`CALL`__ them (data).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- An API (Application Programming Interface) is a technology that will connect you and the server. API allows you to know how many services that the server provides, and allows the server to know who you are. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Foursquare?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Foursquare is a technology company that built a massive dataset of accurate location data. They are very smart on building their dataset, as they actually crows-sourced their data and had people use their app to build their dataset and add venues and complete any issing iinformation they had in their dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Foursquare powers location data for Apple Maps, Uber, Snapchat, Twitter, and many others. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Their API and location data are currently being used by over 100,000 developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Foursquare API Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before we can learn how to retrieve data from the Foursquare server database, we need to create a developer account. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- On May 31st of 2018, Foursquare updated their API, and unlike before, now there are some limitations on how many calls you can make to the API (free account is called __Sandbox Account__). Your current account tier is Sandbox:\n",
    "    - 950 Regular Calls/Day\n",
    "    - 50 Premium Calls/Day\n",
    "    - 1 Photo per Venue\n",
    "    - 1 Tip per Venue\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- The followings are examples of Foursquare API credentials:\n",
    "    - __CLIENT ID__: A4BZ4XU5N3JCM5ROZ05CQIZAKB3MURVFNOM24TRHJOOJIMB3\n",
    "    - __CLIENT SECRET__:I2QABIKFWWEMWYXZIMRFXK4IFSSXTRGG4EPEEVHWP0QYUCYY REVOKED\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Regular Call vs Premium Call\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Foursquare API is really very well documented so if you go to Docs, it will take you to the documentation overview page. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can click on __API__ and then __endpoints overview__, and here you will find the different groups and endpoints available and whether each endpoint falls under a regular or a premium call.\n",
    "https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/places-api/endpoints/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-  So to search for coffee shops around you for example, your call to the API would be considered a regular call. You would use the __search endpoint__ to search for coffee shops around you. This is considered a __regular call__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- But learning more about a venue such as coffee shop would be considered a __premium call__. So you would either use the __details endpoint__ which is considered a premium call or if you want to get the venue's:\n",
    "    - __tips__ or \n",
    "    - the __hours__ \n",
    "    - or the __menu__ or \n",
    "    - any links, \n",

    "\n",
    "## RESTful API\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Communicating with the Foursquare database is really very easy, all thanks to their RESTful API. You simply create a __uniform resource identifier__, or __URI__ (__URL__), and you append it with extra parameters depending on the data that you are seeking from the database. For examples:\n",
