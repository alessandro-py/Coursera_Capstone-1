### Location Data

Location data is data describing places and venues, such as their geographical location, their category, working hours, full address, and so on, such that for a given location given in the form of its geographical coordinates (or latitude and longitude values) one is able __to determine what types of venues exist__ within a defined radius from that location.

For example, given a location you will be able to tell if restaurants, schools, parks, gyms, etc exist nearby. Also, how many of each category exist and how each surrounding venue is reviewed by other people. So this is what's referred to as __location data__. 

### Location Data Providers

Among the many location data providers are:
- Foursquare, 
- Google Places, and 
- Yelp. 

Location data providers will differ in a number of features. 
- Rate Limits: how many API calls you can make in a defined time frame such as calls per hour or calls per day.

- Cost: how much it would cost you to use their API to fetch location data.

- Coverage: geospatial coverage. In other words, how many countries or geographical locations the location data set covers.

- Accuracy: how accurate is the location data provided by each provider, Especially those that crowd source their data. 

- Update Frequency: how frequently the location data gets updated (continuously, daily, or weekly, etc)

So, these are some of the features to keep in mind if in the future you find yourself requiring to use location data to solve a problem.

### Foursquare

But as far as this project is concerned, we will use the Foursquare location dataset. I've been using their API for over a year now, and I have found their dataset to be the most comprehensive so far. Also creating a developer account to use their API is quite straightforward and the easiest compared to other providers. Therefore, let's start learning how to use the Foursquare API to leverage location data.
